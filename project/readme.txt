welcome to my keyboard toy

how to use:

  the first three buttons play a note (higher pitch to lower)
  when a note is pressed the red led is turned on
  the 4th button moves you lower down my sound scale (4 states decreaseing in pitch) in a loop
  the brightness of the green led corresponds to the current state and thus to the current pitch (brigher == higher pitch)
  
 The scale is not following the traditional western scale but a more linear one I programmed
